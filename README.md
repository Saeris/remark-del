## ðŸ”§ Usage

Using this library will depend on your particular application or framework. Below is a bare-bones example to test it in Node.

**Node:**

```ts
import remark from "remark";
import remarkParse from "remark-parse";
import remarkDel from "@saeris/remark-del";
import remarkRehype from "remark-rehype";
import rehypeStringify from "rehype-stringify";

const markdown = `--deleted text--`

const result = await remark()
  .use(remarkParse)
  .use(remarkDel)
  .use(remarkRehype)
  .use(rehypeStringify)
  .process(markdown);

console.log(result.tostring());
// "<p><del class="remark-del">deleted text</del></p>"
```

> [!CAUTION]
>
> Whitespace and newlines on either side of the wrapped text is not supported!
>
> The following will not work:
>
> ```markdown
> -- unsupported whitespace before--
>
> --unsupported whitespace after --
>
> --
> unsupported newline before--
>
> --unsupported newline after
> --
> ```
